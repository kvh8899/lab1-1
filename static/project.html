      <p> In this project me and a team of 3 people asked the question:
        "What makes a videogame popular?". We used existing datasets found
        from kaggle that had data on videogames from 1980-2016. Using this
        data that we cleaned we then used a machine learning model to predict
        if a game would be popular or not based on genre, sales, and critic
        score.
